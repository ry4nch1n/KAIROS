# KAIROS — Test & Verification Plan

This plan defines **what "working" means** for the KAIROS command-center MVP and how each claim is proven. No feature is "done" until its criterion here is verified with evidence (a passing test or an observed browser result).

## Scope of this MVP

- KAIROS shell: 3 services (GameRadar, News Brief, Library) behind an icon rail.
- GameRadar: reads **live from the database**, platform filter (All / Poki / CrazyGames), all Overview charts.
- News Brief: renders editions from the `brief_editions` table.
- Library: intentional empty state.
- Data: real Postgres schema; DB seeded with deterministic sample data; CrazyGames crawler implemented and unit-tested (its live run is not a gate for app verification).

## Environments

| Env | DB | Web | API |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local (verify here)** | PGlite (in-process Postgres, file-persisted) | Vite dev server | Express |
| **Prod (later)** | Neon Postgres | Netlify static | Netlify Functions |

Same SQL + same handlers across both — only the DB driver and the HTTP shell differ.

---

## A. Automated tests (Vitest) — must all pass

Written test-first (TDD). Run with `npm test`.

| # | Test | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | schema applies on fresh PGlite | all tables/views create without error | ⬜ |
| A2 | seed integrity | games > 0, every game has ≥1 snapshot, tags linked, sources = {poki, crazygames} | ⬜ |
| A3 | `getOverview(platform)` | returns `{gamesTracked, avgRating, fastestGenre, openGaps}`; numbers change between `all`/`poki`/`crazygames` | ⬜ |
| A4 | `getGenreMomentum(platform)` | returns series of `{genre, weeks[], values[]}`; respects platform filter | ⬜ |
| A5 | `getTagFrequency(platform)` | returns `[{tag, count}]` sorted desc; platform-filtered | ⬜ |
| A6 | `getHiddenGems(platform)` | every row has `rating ≥ 4.4 AND votes < 5000 AND featured = false` | ⬜ |
| A7 | `getMarketGaps(platform)` | rows ranked by `demand − supply`; demand/supply in 0–100 | ⬜ |
| A8 | `getScatter(platform)` | returns rating×votes points; gems flagged | ⬜ |
| A9 | platform filter isolation | `poki` results contain only `source_id = poki`; `all` ≥ each single platform | ⬜ |
| A10 | `getBriefEditions()` / `getBriefEdition(date)` | list sorted desc; payload JSON parses into sections | ⬜ |
| A11 | CrazyGames adapter parse | parsing a saved fixture yields expected `{title,url,rating,tags,...}` | ⬜ |
| A12 | append-only load | re-running load for same crawl day inserts 0 duplicate snapshots (idempotent) | ⬜ |
| A13 | API routes | `GET /api/overview?platform=poki` etc. return 200 + correct JSON shape | ⬜ |

## B. Browser end-to-end (manual + MCP-driven) — must all pass

Drive the running app with the browser/preview MCP; capture a screenshot per check.

| # | Check | Pass criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | App boots | no blank screen; no uncaught console errors | ⬜ |
| B2 | Rail switches services | clicking Radar/Brief/Library swaps sidebar + content; active state correct | ⬜ |
| B3 | Radar charts render | momentum (lines), tag treemap, scatter, feature heatmap all draw with data from API | ⬜ |
| B4 | Platform selector | clicking All/Poki/CrazyGames re-renders KPIs + all charts + gaps + insights with different values | ⬜ |
| B5 | KPI ↔ chart consistency | KPI "games tracked" matches the platform's seeded game count | ⬜ |
| B6 | Brief reader | Brief tab lists editions; selecting one renders its sections (refs/signals/actions) | ⬜ |
| B7 | Library empty state | shows intentional empty state (icon, copy, ghost cards, disabled CTA) — not an error/blank | ⬜ |
| B8 | Loading & empty | charts show a loading state then data; no flash of broken axes | ⬜ |
| B9 | Responsive | at 1280 and 1024 widths layout holds; no horizontal scroll | ⬜ |
| B10 | No console errors | console clean across all three services after interaction | ⬜ |

## C. Usability bar (subjective, but checked)

- C1 Visual matches the approved light-mode mockup (rail + sidebar + cards, Fira fonts, blue/amber).
- C2 Service switch feels instant (< 150ms perceived); charts resize correctly after switch.
- C3 Tooltips appear on chart hover with exact values.
- C4 Nothing looks "placeholder broken" — empty states are designed, numbers are formatted (tabular, thousands separators).

## D. Phase 2 — Steam source ingestion (automated, TDD) — must all pass

Added 2026-06-30. The primary Phase 2 goal: ingest PC Steam data as a new `'steam'` source, scoped to a solo-dev funnel (analytics default to the indie-addressable cohort; AAA kept as demand context). Pure transforms are unit-tested against **real captured fixtures** (`test/fixtures/steam_*_1145360.json` — Hades) + synthetic boundary inputs. Run with `npm test`.

| # | Test | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | schema has Steam columns | fresh PGlite has `games.release_date` + `game_snapshots.{price_cents,discount_pct,owners_est,ccu,median_playtime_min,metacritic,scale_tier,plays}`; re-applying schema is idempotent | ⬜ |
| D2 | `parseOwners` | SteamSpy `"5,000,000 .. 10,000,000"` → midpoint `7,500,000`; handles single + malformed → null | ⬜ |
| D3 | `normalizeSteamRating` | `276574/282133` → `4.90` on a 0–5 scale; 0 reviews → null | ⬜ |
| D4 | `classifyScaleTier` | **AAA = publisher backing, not units sold.** A self-published breakout (Hades/Terraria-scale) caps at `est_indie`; only a major-backed title (via `isMajorBacked`) is `aaa`; small self-pub → `hobby`/`small_indie` | ⬜ |
| D2c | `rankTagByOwners` | ranks a SteamSpy tag object by estimated owners **desc**, NOT `Object.keys` appid order (which returns oldest games) | ⬜ |
| D2e | `parseSearchAppids` | extracts + dedups `data-ds-appid` from a Steam store-search `results_html` fragment | ⬜ |
| D6c | `isMajorBacked` | mega-publisher / first-party label (Sony, Valve, EA…) → true; indie-friendly publisher (Devolver…) → false | ⬜ |
| DR | `parseReleaseDate` | **both** day-first (`"17 Sep, 2020"`) and month-first (`"Mar 25, 2025"`) display strings → ISO; coming-soon → null | ⬜ |
| DQ | `assessSteamDataQuality` | flags all-null dates, all-AAA (empty indie seed), collapsed comparables, near-empty crawl; passes a healthy sample | ⬜ |
| D5 | `parseSteamGame` (Hades fixture) | maps 3 endpoints → RawGame: rating 4.90, votes 282133, ownersEst 7.5M, price 550¢, developer "Supergiant Games", tags from SteamSpy, genre, releaseDate, scaleTier valid | ⬜ |
| D6 | self-published detection | publisher ⊆ developer (or empty) ⇒ `selfPublished=true`; distinct big publisher ⇒ false | ⬜ |
| D7 | loader persists Steam fields | loading a Steam RawGame writes price/owners/ccu/tier/plays into `game_snapshots`; browser path unaffected (new cols null) | ⬜ |
| D8 | loader idempotency (steam) | re-running same crawl day inserts 0 duplicate snapshots | ⬜ |
| D9 | `getScaleTierBreakdown('steam')` | returns per-tier game counts; sums to total Steam games | ⬜ |
| D10 | `getSteamGenreEconomics` (indie-default) | per genre: games, median price, median rating, total owners, revenue proxy (owners×price); excludes `aaa` tier by default; AAA included when `cohort:'all'` | ⬜ |
| D11 | platform isolation incl. steam | `getOverview`/queries with `platform='steam'` touch only `source_id = steam`; browser queries exclude steam | ⬜ |

## E. Phase 2 — end-to-end validation (live) — evidence required

| # | Check | Pass criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | live seed | `seedAppIds()` returns a deduped, owners-ranked list: indie **top-sellers** (recency) + `tag=indie` (**lowercase** — case-sensitive; owners-ranked via `rankTagByOwners`, not appid-order) + trending + featured + `INDIE_CANON`. The **indie stream is non-empty** (guards the `tag=Indie` empty-response bug) | ⬜ |
| E2 | live enrich→load | crawling N real appids into a fresh PGlite inserts N snapshots with non-null rating/votes/owners/price for the majority | ⬜ |
| E3 | indie analytics on real data | `getSteamGenreEconomics` over the live sample yields sane rows (positive owners, price in cents, revenue proxy), indie cohort < full cohort | ⬜ |
| E4 | tier distribution sane | live sample spans ≥2 tiers; AAA share excluded from indie-default analytics | ⬜ |
| E5 | **recency + accuracy gate** | live sample: `release_date` non-null for the **majority** (guards the date-parser/locale regression); indie cohort **non-degenerate** (not all-AAA); `getSteamComparables` **populated** and every row within the recency window; golden appids classify correctly (Hades → indie-tier, CS2/PUBG → aaa). Same invariants as the §F canary. | ⬜ |

**Deferred to a follow-on build (documented, not in this turn's DoD):** promotion-capture homepage crawl; React UI surfaces (Bridge / Comparables / Opportunity board, Steam platform selector); daily `crawl.yml` wiring. The data layer this turn must be production-shaped so those land cleanly.

## F. Ongoing data-quality canary (post-crawl gate) — added 2026-07-01

**Why this layer exists.** The A/D tests validate *shape* (right columns, deduped, platform-isolated); they cannot see *stale or wrong data*. Every recency/accuracy bug shipped this session slipped through green suites: a crawl "succeeded" while the indie seed was silently empty (all-AAA fallback), a broken date parser left `release_date` all-null, and Comparables collapsed to two rows. Data bugs also regress **after** merge when the upstream (Steam/SteamSpy) changes — locale leaks, API/tag changes, ranking shifts. A one-time test can't catch that; a standing gate can.

**Mechanism.** `assessSteamDataQuality` (pure, unit-tested — see DQ) encodes the invariants; `server/scripts/check-steam-data.ts` runs them against the live DB plus golden-appid spot-checks and exits non-zero on failure. Wired as the **final step of the daily crawl** (`crawl.yml`) so a degenerate crawl turns the run **red** instead of looking green. Run locally with `npm run check:steam`.

F1–F4 are measured over the **freshest crawl cohort** (games whose latest snapshot is from the most recent crawl day), not the whole append-only DB — legacy rows keep null dates a single crawl can't fix, so all-time measurement would false-fail forever. F5 is the exception: the actual queryable UI output over all live Steam games.

| # | Invariant | Fails when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | crawl produced data | latest crawl `< 50` games | ⬜ |
| F2 | date accuracy | `release_date` fill `< 50%` of the fresh cohort (date parser / locale regression) | ⬜ |
| F3 | rating fill | rating fill `< 40%` of the fresh cohort | ⬜ |
| F4 | indie cohort non-degenerate | fresh-cohort `indie (non-aaa) < 15` (empty indie seed → all-AAA, or scale-as-AAA over-classification) | ⬜ |
| F5 | recent comparables populated | `getSteamComparables < 3` over all live Steam (recency window / seed-recency regression) | ⬜ |
| F6 | golden classifications | Hades (1145360) is `aaa`, or CS2 (730) / PUBG (578080) is not `aaa` | ⬜ |

Thresholds are deliberately conservative (fire only on genuine degeneracy, not normal variance) and live in one place (`DEFAULT_STEAM_QUALITY`). The gate **detects, not prevents** — the append-only load has already happened — but a red run surfaces the exact silent-bad-data failure mode a green crawl would hide.

---

## Definition of Done (MVP)

1. **All A-tests green**, output pristine (no errors/warnings).
2. **All B-checks pass** with a screenshot as evidence.
3. **C bar** met on review.
4. `npm run dev` brings up the full command center against the seeded DB with one command (after `npm install` + `npm run db:seed`).
5. Docs current: README run steps work as written; DESIGN/OPERATIONS reflect the as-built stack.

## Iteration protocol (when something fails)

1. Reproduce → write/adjust a failing test that captures the defect (for logic bugs).
2. Fix minimally → re-run that test → re-run full suite.
3. Re-verify the related B-check in the browser.
4. Record the fix in the table above (flip ⬜ → ✅, note the fix).
Do not flip a box to ✅ without observed evidence.

## Verification run — RESULTS (2026-06-26)

**A. Automated (Vitest): 17/17 PASS.** A1 schema, A2 seed integrity, A3 overview (platform-differentiated, all = poki+cg), A4 momentum, A5 tag freq, A6 hidden gems (all rating≥4.4 & votes<5000), A7 market gaps (ranked, 0–100), A8 scatter, A8b heatmap, A9 platform isolation, A10 brief, A11 CrazyGames parse (real `__NEXT_DATA__` fixture), A12 append-only idempotency (2nd same-day load inserts 0), A13 API routes (200 + shapes). Command: `npm test`.

**B. Browser E2E (DOM-verified via preview MCP): PASS.**
- B1 boots, no uncaught errors · B10 **zero console errors** across all interaction.
- B2 rail switches services (radar→brief→library→radar), active state + visibility correct.
- B3 Radar draws **4 chart canvases** (momentum/treemap/scatter/heatmap) with real sizes.
- B4 platform selector: All→120 games, Poki→59, subtitle/KPIs/gaps/fastest all re-render.
- B5 KPI "games tracked" = seeded count (120 / 59). 
- B6 Brief: editions list (Jun 26 THU, Jun 23 MON), 4 sections, ref cards, signals, actions from `brief_editions`.
- B7 Library: designed empty state (heading, copy, 4 ghost cards, disabled CTA, "V2" note).
- B8 charts show skeleton→data · B9 responsive 1024 (KPIs→2 cols, no horizontal overflow) and 1440 OK.
- Charts re-render correctly after hide/show (ResizeObserver).

**Build:** `npm run build` → `web/dist` produced (deployable). Note: ECharts full import → 1.2 MB JS (397 KB gzip); flagged for later modular-import optimization (non-blocking).

**Screenshots:** the preview harness's image capture timed out on the canvas-heavy page; rendering was instead verified programmatically (canvas dimensions, DOM content, computed styles, console). App itself is error-free.

**Definition of Done: MET** — all A green, all B verified, one-command `npm run dev` against seeded PGlite, docs current.

---

## Verification run — Phase 2 (Steam ingestion) RESULTS (2026-06-30)

**D. Automated (Vitest): 23/23 PASS** in `test/steam.test.ts` (full suite **78 green** — server 59 + web 19; no regressions). Written test-first (RED→GREEN watched for every function). Command: `npm test`.
- D1 schema (Steam columns present + idempotent re-apply) · D2 `parseOwners` midpoint · D2b `mergeSeeds` round-robin · D3 `normalizeSteamRating` (276574/282133→4.90) · D4 `classifyScaleTier` boundaries · D5 `parseSteamGame` (Hades, 3 real fixtures) · D6 `isSelfPublished` · D7 loader persists Steam fields + browser path unaffected · D8 loader idempotency · D9 `getScaleTierBreakdown` · D10 `getSteamGenreEconomics` (indie-default excludes AAA; `cohort:'all'` includes) · D11 platform isolation incl. steam.
- Fixtures are **real captured payloads** (`test/fixtures/steam_*_1145360.json` — Hades) committed for regression.

**E. Live end-to-end (real Steam/SteamSpy network): PASS** via `npx tsx server/scripts/validate-steam.ts` (limit 18).
- E1 seed: `seedAppIds` returns a deduped, round-robin-merged list (indie + trending + featured). 18 appids.
- E2 enrich→load: **18/18 inserted**; field fill rating 15/18, votes 15/18, owners 18/18, price 16/18 (nulls = zero-review / free titles — expected).
- E4 tiers: distribution spans all four — `hobby:7 aaa:6 small_indie:3 est_indie:2`.
- E3 indie analytics: cohort sizes **indie 12 < all 18** (AAA correctly excluded); `getSteamGenreEconomics` yields sane rows (median price, rating, owners, revenue proxy).

**Defect caught & fixed during validation (self-annealing).** The first live run returned a **100%-AAA** sample (Team Fortress 2, Half-Life, Counter-Strike…) → empty indie cohort. Root cause: `seedAppIds` concatenated sources then sliced, letting the AAA-heavy `top100in2weeks` crowd out the indie stream at small limits. Fix: extracted a pure `mergeSeeds()` that **round-robin interleaves** the lists (indie first), unit-tested (D2b), re-validated → mixed-tier sample. This is the exact AAA-skew the Phase 2 design warned about; the test locks it in.

**Server typecheck:** `tsc --noEmit` shows only project-wide TS5097 (`.ts` import-extension) notices that predate this work and don't apply to the `tsx`/vitest runtime gate; **zero semantic type errors** in the new code. Web build: `npm run build` → `dist` produced.

**Scope shipped this turn (data layer, production-shaped):** schema (`release_date` + 7 Steam snapshot columns incl. `scale_tier`, additive/idempotent for Neon) · `crawler/steam.ts` (pure transforms + `steamCrawl` orchestrator + indie-aware seed) · loader extended · `getScaleTierBreakdown` + `getSteamGenreEconomics` · `crawl:steam` wired (root + server) · live validation script.
**Deferred (documented):** promotion-capture homepage crawl; React UI surfaces (Bridge / Comparables / Opportunity board, Steam selector) + API routes for them; daily `crawl.yml` Steam step. The data layer is shaped so these land cleanly.

---

## Verification run — Phase 2 (Steam analytics UI) RESULTS (2026-06-30)

Steam wired into the live GameRadar dashboard as a fourth platform (selector All / Poki / CrazyGames / **Steam**). New automated tests (all green):
- **D10b** `getSteamGenreEconomics` medianRating → **null** (not a misleading 0) for a reviewless cohort.
- **D12** `getSteamComparables` — indie-tier rated games, owners desc. **D13** `getSteamOverview` — composes kpi + tiers + both cohorts + comparables. **D14** `GET /api/steam` → 200 + shape (Express; mirrored in the Netlify function).
- **Web F1** `tierBarOption` chart builder — AAA grey `#cbd5e1`, indie blue `#2563eb`, every tier+count present.

**Live UI validation (preview MCP, DOM-verified — ECharts canvas times out pixel capture, same limitation noted for the MVP):**
- Steam tab renders: title "Steam (PC) Market", KPIs **games 20 · indie 13 · AAA 7 · rated 85%**, tier-distribution ECharts canvas, genre-economics table (Action `$1.06 · 4.49 · 5.03M · $8.49M`), comparables **10 rows** (Half-Life: Opposing Force / Uplink / DEFCON …), tier chips colored. **No console errors.**
- **Cohort toggle indie↔all works:** Action flips 5 games/5.03M/$8.49M → **12 games/130M/$211.1B** + the AAA-skew warning — the indie-default thesis, live.
- Browser platforms unaffected (poki overview 200, 59 games). Local e2e: `db:seed` + `crawl:steam` (20 real games) → dev API `/api/steam` → dashboard renders.

**Total: 85 tests green** (server 63 + web 22). Web build clean. `/api/steam` served live and DOM-verified.

**Still deferred (next build):** Bridge (browser→Steam graduation) + Comparables deep-dive as their own views; promotion-capture homepage crawl; daily `crawl.yml` Steam step.

### Phase 2 fix — `all` is browser-only (D15, 2026-06-30)
**Bug caught via the live dashboard:** with Steam loaded, the browser "Genre vote-velocity" chart on platform `all` showed large fake negatives (Horror −513, Idle −225…). Cause: `pf("all")` returned no source filter, so Steam's single later crawl date (06-30, vs browser's 06-26) entered the shared date axis; `genreVotesByDate` zero-fills missing (genre,date) cells, so browser genres read as dropping to 0 on the Steam date → velocity `(0 − first)/days` went hugely negative (and Steam-only genres got fake positives). **Fix:** `pf("all")` = `src.name IN ('poki','crazygames')` — Steam is an asymmetric surface and never feeds browser analytics. Regression test **D15**. Post-fix: Horror −513 → +930, Steam genres absent from browser `all`, gamesTracked back to 120. Server suite now 64 green (86 total).

---

## Verification run — Recency & accuracy hardening (2026-07-01)

**Context.** A batch of Steam Comparables defects surfaced in prod that the green suite hadn't caught — all **recency/accuracy** (data-wrong, shape-right), which the plan validated poorly. Root causes fixed: month-first `release_date` strings parsed to null; `classifyScaleTier` treated commercial scale as AAA (filtering out self-published hits like Hades/Balatro); the indie seed used `tag=Indie` (capital-I → SteamSpy returns `{}`, empty stream) and `Object.keys` appid-ordering (oldest games first); Comparables window too narrow on a sparsely-dated column. Recency seed added (indie top-sellers search); AAA redefined as **publisher backing, not scale**.

**New coverage (this is the point):**
- **Unit accuracy (§D):** `parseReleaseDate` both date formats (DR), `classifyScaleTier` backing-not-scale (D4), `isMajorBacked` (D6c), `rankTagByOwners` (D2c), `parseSearchAppids` (D2e), `assessSteamDataQuality` degeneracy detection (DQ, 6 cases).
- **Live data-quality (§E5):** recency + parse-fill + tier-sanity + golden-appid asserts folded into `validate-steam.ts` (now exits non-zero on failure).
- **Ongoing canary (§F):** `check:steam` gate wired as the daily crawl's final step — fails the run on empty indie seed, null-date epidemic, collapsed comparables, or a golden misclassification.

**Automated: 115 green** (server **90** + web 25). New: `test/steamDataQuality.test.ts` (6) + the accuracy units above. Command `npm test`.

**Canary validated against real crawled data (local, 60 games):** `total 60 · dateFill 100% · rated 80% · indie 45 · comparables 6` → **gate passed**; golden live: **PUBG=aaa, Hades=est_indie, CS2=aaa** (backing-not-scale semantics confirmed end-to-end).

**Stale entries corrected (self-annealing):** D4 (was "scale → aaa") and E1 (was "`tag=Indie`" + old seed mix) now document the as-built behavior; they previously *encoded the bugs*.

## Verification run — Phase A/B/C, the 5-factor decision layer (2026-07-11)

Nine PRs (#58, #61–#66) reoriented KAIROS around the five game-selection factors. All server work is payload extensions on existing routes (route-parity untouched); each phase shipped tested + browser-verified + 375px-safe.

**New / extended coverage:**
- **Contract + pitch (C1):** `test/contract.test.ts` — pitch **v5** version bump, `contentScopes` taxonomy, the five score axes, `grayBoxDays`/`contentScope` validation. `test/pitches.test.ts` — a DB round-trip test for all seven v5 columns (`gray_box_days`/`content_scope`/`tech_risk`/`hook`/`marketability`/`founder_fit`/`why_me`).
- **B1 canonicalization:** in `test/queries.test.ts` — `canonicalName` unit cases (suffix collapse, clean-name identity), a SQL↔JS **parity** test, and an injected-duplicate end-to-end merge ("Puzzle Games" → "Puzzle" across genres + tags).
- **B2 supply velocity:** `classifySupply` unit cases + an end-to-end "flooded genre reads rising" + gap `supplyRising` shape.
- **B3 quadrant:** `getOverview().quadrant` per-genre shape + canonical-genre assertion; `charts.test.ts` — `quadrantOption` point mapping, median cross, log axes.
- **A1 decision layer:** `read` array (1–3 lines, each with a "→" implication), every insight carries an implication, `GenreRow.trajectory`; `composeBrowserRead`/`composeSteamRead` threshold units.
- **B4 conversion:** `test/genreConversion.test.ts` — cited signal per genre, case-insensitivity, null-on-no-signal.
- **A2/C2 web:** `steamRevenue.test.ts` scenario band; `revenue.test.ts` private-target band + persistence; `lib/routeLean.test.ts` — every route-lean case.

**Automated: ~227 green** (server **170** + web **57**). Command `npm test`; `npm run build` clean. Live-verified in-browser (DOM/JS, ECharts canvas pixel-capture still times out): read strips, supply column + gap flags, quadrant chart, conversion/content/recent chips, and a v5 pitch (published through the real `publishPitch` write path) rendering scope chips + Hook/Founder dots + the route-lean chip on card and Leaderboard.

**No crawl/backfill needed:** B1 is query-time; conversion data is static; the v5 `pitches` columns migrate additively via `db:migrate` (runs in `crawl.yml`). Existing pitches render null-safe until the weekly routine re-authors them with v5 fields.
